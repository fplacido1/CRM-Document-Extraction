## 🧠 Challenge: Community Connection Graph

In this strategic consulting challenge, your team will develop an innovative solution that transforms unstructured data into actionable community intelligence.

You'll be working with a dataset of physical forms containing citizen profile information *(personal data, interests, preferences, diseases, event reviews)* that have been captured through **mobile photography in non-ideal conditions** (blurry images, poor lighting, varied quality).

### **Objective**  
Design an **end-to-end intelligence platform** that:
- Extracts unstructured information
- Standardizes it
- Builds a powerful **graph database** that integrates with a CRM platform  
  → This will optimize company interactions with clients.

Go beyond basic data processing—**integrate real-time community event data** to:
- Create a dynamic **recommendation engine**
- Identify relevant upcoming events for specific community segments, or other relevant information that can be referenced
- Suggest tailored content based on each client's profile

Show how advanced **OCR**, **graph architecture**, and **data enrichment** can turn fragmented inputs into a cohesive community intelligence system that **drives meaningful engagement opportunities**.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset includes **30 `.jpeg` images**  
Captured using **mobile phones**, each image contains **unstructured profile data** about individual citizens, such as interests and preferences  

---

## 🛠 Tech & Tools

🚨 **Mandatory Requirement**  
All development must be in **Google Colab using Python**

You are free to choose any:
- **📚 Libraries**: Use any tool you need, such as `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`, `LangChain`, etc.
- **📈 Visualization tools**: Python-based tools (`Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`), `Power BI`, `Tableau`
- **🤖 AI Assistants**: Feel free to consult `ChatGPT`, `GitHub Copilot`, `Gemini`, etc.

---

## ⏱ Time Management & Rules

- ⏳ You have **4 hours** to complete the challenge  
  🔒 **No extensions**. Use it wisely.

- 🗣 Present a **5-minute consulting pitch**  
  🎯 Simulate a **client-facing delivery**. You’ll be evaluated on your solution and how well you communicate it.

- 👥 Each group may request:
  - `1` **technical support session** (up to 5 minutes)
  - `1` **business support session** (up to 5 minutes)

> 💬 Assistants won’t give you the solution — they'll guide your thinking

## 📋 Strategy & Workflow Tips

This is a **consulting-style challenge**. Time is tight — here’s how to win:

1. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Assign roles early**  
   E.g., data engineer, business analyst, presenter

2. ⏱️ **Work in parallel**  
   Don’t wait on each other — split & conquer

3. 🎤 **Start building the presentation early**  
   Don’t leave it for the final 10 minutes

4. ✅ **Be realistic**  
   It’s better to deliver a focused, clear, and well-explained solution than a rushed or overly complex one.

> 🧠 Judging is based on **teamwork**, **structure**, and **strategic thinking**, not just technical skills
